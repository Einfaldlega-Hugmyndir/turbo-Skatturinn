# Turbo Skatturinn
software that works for both USA and Icelandic taxes for business owners

The financial software is primarily focused on personal financial software that generates a USA tax liability form and imports information from the Icelandic tax reporting authority. We are willing to pay a maximum of 1 million ISK for the first year of operating expenses. 

## Side software
1. As a side thing there will also be some software that uses OCR to read your Icelandic payslip and puts it into English and or layman speak so it's easy for you to read.
2. [Compound Interest Calculator](https://github.com/Einfaldlega-Hugmyndir/Compound_Interest_Calculator)
3. Also there will be a housing finder software to figure out when is the best time to busy a mortgage based on the user's inputting requirements and wishes.
